<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There is lots of power among those that code, and one of the greatest is the lack of limitations. There is no limit to what exactly you can do. Here, we make a fully automated etiing system with high end features. Basically every single thind that i learn, i inject here

Here's why:
* I leave in a third world country where poverty could kill you itself, many people rely on betting to try their best of luck and get what they deserve.
* Betting companies are a good scum, looking at the distribution of odds, the adds, percenteges and alocation of money, with this technology, me and my team are going to scum the scum.
* People that do business say that betting is another game to waste money,... but farming is also a bet, it depends on statistics and chance to be successfull, that is exactly what we are going to use here.
* I also just enjoy to prove a point :smile:

I so sick and tired of these systems well engneered to give you one reason why you should loose your investment
I am not so experienced in what i do so even a beginner can understand my code so, fork it now.

### Built With
Currently its built with:
* [Selenium for python](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [BeautifullSoup](https://jquery.com)
* [Requests](https://laravel.com)
* [Just get the whole anaconda engiene because its about to get hot in here]


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap
We plan on adding these soon
* Gui with good visualisation in pyqt.
* Neuralnet to optimise data and create more algorithms thru personal learning.
* Another bot to create multiple accounts on many betting systems and bet.
* Bot to gather data for statistical calculations(for each footballer(injury, previous performance, league performance, home and away, blabla))

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS -->

* Eddie Thokerunga (Footballer and programmer, encouraged me to put this on github so i can have a clear roadmap)
